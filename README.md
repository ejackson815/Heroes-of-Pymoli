Assignment reading JSON files and analyzing data via Pandas
Three take aways from the data
1)There is a larger percentage of males that participate in this game
2)We see the most purchases between the ages of 25-29
3)Can't determine if the data is over a week or a daily pull, for this analysis I am assuming it is a daily pull.  The game generated a net revenue.
